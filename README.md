Text Emotion Classifier with Streamlit:
This repository contains a Text Emotion Classifier application built using Python and Streamlit. The app uses a machine learning model trained with a Naive Bayes classifier to classify text comments into predefined emotion categories like joy, anger, and fear.


Features:
Classifies user-provided text into one of the predefined emotion categories.
Interactive web-based interface built with Streamlit.
Model trained on a sample dataset using scikit-learn.
Save and reuse the trained model for predictions.
